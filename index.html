                        <p class="faq-description">Beta (β) is a tool used to measure the risk of stocks and investments. Specifically, it indicates how much the stock you are investing in (e.g., shares of a company) tends to move compared to the overall market (e.g., stock market indices like the S&P500 index).
                            Meaning of Beta values:
    •    (β = 1): The stock's movement tends to be the same as the overall market.
    •    (β > 1): The stock moves more aggressively than the market. It carries higher risk, but it might also offer higher returns.
    •    (β < 1): The stock moves more moderately than the market. It has lower risk, but the returns may be more conservative.
    •    (β = 0): There is no relationship between the stock's movement and the market's movement.
    •    (β < 0): The stock moves in the opposite direction to the market.
    To put it in simpler terms, Beta is like a roller coaster ride. A vehicle with a Beta of 1 moves at an average speed and motion. A vehicle with a Beta of 2 moves at twice the speed and motion, making it more thrilling! A vehicle with a Beta of 0.5 moves at a slower pace.
Knowing the Beta can help you select stocks that align with your investment style.</p>
